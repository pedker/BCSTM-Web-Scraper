# Web Scraper
This project was hastily created in response to the death of the website smashcustommusic.com

The site hosted user-created edits of video game soundtracks, encoded in their native "stream" filetype, which allowed the audio to play on an infinite loop by using loop-points.

This script allowed me to quickly download as many songs as I could in a .bcstm format before the site was ultimately taken down.

# Download
There is only one file: scraper.py

download, view, edit, and run it.

# Legality
This is a legal use of web scraping. The function of this script is to essentially click on the download buttons offered by the site automatically and efficiently.

# What I Learned
* Basics of web scraping
* Basics of HTML web-page structures and hrefs
* Using the BeautifulSoup4 API
