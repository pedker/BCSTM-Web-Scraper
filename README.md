# Web Scraper
This project was hastily created in response to the death of the website smashcustommusic.com

The site hosted user-created edits of video game soundtracks, encoded in their native "stream" filetype, which allowed the audio to play on an infinite loop by using loop-points.

This script allowed me to quickly download as many songs as I could in a .bcstm format before the site was ultimately taken down.

(As of 2021, the site is now smashcustommusic.net, and while currently operational, operates on heavily limited bandwidth and is constantly under threat of death by Copyright Law)

# Download
There is only one file: scraper.py

download, view, edit, and run it.

# Legality
This is a legal use of web scraping. The function of this script is to essentially click on the download buttons offered by the site automatically and efficiently.

# What I Learned
* Basics of web scraping
* Basics of HTML web-page structures and hrefs
* Using the BeautifulSoup4 API
